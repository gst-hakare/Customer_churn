# Customer_churn
Customer churn dataset using python

# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn by identifying key factors influencing customer retention and predicting churn using machine learning models. The goals include:

- Understanding churn behavior through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Identifying key features that impact customer churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure).
- Building a machine learning model to predict if a customer will churn or stay.
- Providing actionable insights for businesses to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

# Conclusion
After conducting data analysis, feature engineering, and model training, we obtained the following conclusions:

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate compared to those with long-term contracts.
- Higher monthly charges lead to increased customer churn.
- Customers using electronic payment methods are more likely to churn.
- Longer tenure customers are less likely to churn, indicating loyalty over time.
- The Random Forest model provided an accuracy of ~80%, making it a reliable model for churn prediction.

## Business Impact 
- Business Impact: By implementing targeted strategies like discounted long-term contracts, loyalty rewards, and improved customer service, businesses can reduce churn and increase customer retention.
